## Definition

Simple graphical front end for sending messages via `msg.exe` on *Windows* systems.

[Top](#msgui-)

## Details

Initially, *MsgUI* was developed for administrators of a terminal server to notify either all or a specific user of a certain event.

Even though, administrators should be able to use the command-line or the *PowerShell*, this program simplifies the notification process.

As you can see on the right, the project is quite elementary and, as such, not a complete alternative for the command-line use of `msg.exe`.

Notice that `msg.exe` is not included in all *Windows* editions. Details can be found [below](#requirements).

## Environment

Even though *MsgUI* uses `msg.exe` on every *Windows* system, there are differences how the message is being displayed depending on the environment used.

### Locked screen with embedded message

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urbanware-org/msgui/main/Stuff/GitHub/MsgUI_Win2016.png" alt="MsgUI on Windows Server 2016" width="200px" align="right"/>For example, on *Windows Server 2016*, after the message has been sent, the screen of the recipients gets darkened, sort of locked and the message is displayed in the center of the screen.

The user must confirm the message to continue working (if no delay is set to automatically hide it again).

### Movable message box

Nevertheless, it is always on top (in the foreground) and cannot be minimized.

## Requirements

### Binary

There are only two requirements in order to use the program.

> [!NOTE]
> The `msg.exe` binary is only included in *Windows Professional*, *Windows Enterprise* and *Windows Educational* (e.g. *Windows 11 SE*) editions as well as *Windows Server* products in general.

*   *Microsoft Windows 7* and above or alternatively *Microsoft Windows Server 2003* and above
*   *Microsoft .NET Framework* 4.5 (or higher)

### Source code

The solution file requires at least *Microsoft Visual Studio 2012*. The initially uploaded binary has been compiled using *Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition*.

Feel free to fork and modify!
