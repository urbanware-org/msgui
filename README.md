## Definition

Simple graphical front end for sending messages via `msg.exe` on *Windows* systems.

[Top](#msgui-)

## Details

Initially, *MsgUI* was developed for administrators of a terminal server to notify either all or a specific user of a certain event.

Even though, administrators should be able to use the command-line or the *PowerShell*, this program simplifies the notification process.

As you can see on the right, the project is quite elementary and, as such, not a complete alternative for the command-line use of `msg.exe`.

## Requirements

### Binary

There are only two requirements in order to use the program:

*   *Microsoft Windows* version that contains `msg.exe` (should be included by default in *Windows 7* and above)
*   *Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0* (or higher)

Notice that it has only been tested and used on *Windows Server 2008 R2* and *Windows Server 2016*, yet.

### Source code

The solution file requires at least *Microsoft Visual Studio 2012*. The initially uploaded binary has been compiled using *Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition*.

Feel free to fork and modify!
