## Definition

Simple graphical front end for sending messages via `msg.exe` on _Windows_ systems.

[Top](#msgui-)

## Details

Initially, _MsgUI_ was developed for administrators of a terminal server to notify either all or a specific user of a certain event.

Even though, administrators should be able to use the command-line or the _PowerShell_, this program simplifies the notification process.

As you can see on the right, the project is quite elementary and, as such, not a complete alternative for the command-line use of `msg.exe`.

## Requirements

### Binary

There are only two requirements in order to use the program:

 * _Microsoft Windows_ version that contains `msg.exe` (should be included by default in _Windows 7_ and above)
 * _Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0_ (or higher)

Notice that it has only been tested and used on _Windows Server 2008 R2_ and _Windows Server 2016_, yet.

### Source code

The solution file requires at least _Microsoft Visual Studio 2012_. The initially uploaded binary has been compiled using _Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition_.

Feel free to fork and modify!
